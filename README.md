Project Abstract: Online Store API

The Online Store API is a Laravel-based backend system that serves as the core infrastructure for an e-commerce platform. It provides a set of RESTful endpoints for managing various aspects of the online store, including categories, products, user addresses, orders, order items, product images, and user authentication.

Key Features:

Authentication: Users can register, log in, log out, and refresh their authentication tokens. This ensures secure access to the API endpoints.
Categories Management: Administrators can create, retrieve, update, and delete product categories. This allows for efficient organization and navigation of products within the store.
Products Management: Administrators can manage product listings, including creating, retrieving, updating, and deleting products. Each product includes details such as name, price, and description.
User Addresses: Users can manage their shipping addresses by creating, retrieving, updating, and deleting addresses. This feature facilitates smooth order processing and delivery.
Orders Processing: Users can place orders by adding products to their cart and completing the checkout process. Administrators can view and manage orders, including order status and fulfillment.
Order Items: Each order consists of one or more order items, representing the products purchased by the user. Administrators can manage order items to track inventory and fulfill orders accurately.
Product Images: Product listings can include multiple images to showcase the product from different angles. Administrators can upload, retrieve, update, and delete product images to enhance the shopping experience.
Technology Stack:

Backend Framework: Laravel (PHP)
Database: MySQL or any supported database system
Authentication: JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for user authentication and authorization
API Documentation: Swagger or similar tools for documenting API endpoints
Conclusion:

The Online Store API provides a robust backend solution for managing an e-commerce platform. With its comprehensive set of features and intuitive API design, it enables seamless interaction between clients (web, mobile apps) and the backend system. By leveraging Laravel's capabilities, the project ensures scalability, security, and maintainability, making it suitable for businesses of all sizes.
